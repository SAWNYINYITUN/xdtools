# XD Tools

**This is currently a WIP.** XD Tools is an unofficial Python API for Adobe XD. It provides the ability to parse and read data from `.xd` files that are created by Adobe XD using Python 3. As Adobe XD is constantly changing each month with new features, this API will inevitably change in order to stay up-to-date, so please report issues on GitHub if you find any.

## Installation

```
pip install xdtools
```
